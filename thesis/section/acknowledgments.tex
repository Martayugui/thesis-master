I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor Theofilos Kakantousis for the continuous support during the time of the internship.
His experience in the fields of the project, a head full of ideas and accurate questions, and willingness to advice were extremely helpful and made the internship an invaluable experience.\\
I would also like to thank my university supervisor Professor Mariano Ruiz for helping me with the project, making the thesis procedure smooth, and for agreeing to do all of it fully remotely.
