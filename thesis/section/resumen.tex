Hyperspectral imaging collect and process information from across the electromagnetic spectrum.While the human eye sees color of visible light in mainly three bands, however, hyperspectral images cover a wide range of wavelengths.This imaging modality was developed, as the first approach, for remote sensing and earth observations, the multiple applications and the wide information provided do 

The accurate delimitation of brain cancer is an important task having a surgery. Several techniques are used in order to guide neurosurgeons in the removal of the tumor. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a promising non-invasive and non-ionizing optical imaging modality that has the ability to speed-up medical imaging research and clinical practice.
